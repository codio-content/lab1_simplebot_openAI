## Pushing to GitHub

For the final step, you must push your work to GitHub. 



1. On the left side, you should see a file tree with the `nlp-simplebot` folder.


2. Click on your `simplebot.py` file outside of the folder and copy its contents.

3. Now, go inside the `nlp-simplebot` folder and open the `simplebot.py` file.

4. Paste the contents of your `simplebot.py` file into the `simplebot.py` file within the `nlp-simplebot` folder.


5. In the terminal, run the command `cd nlp-simplebot` to move into the folder connected to GitHub.


* Now we can  Commit your changes:

```bash 
git add .
git commit -m "Finished The Simple Bots"
