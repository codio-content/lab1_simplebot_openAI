One of the most common tasks and a subset of Natural Language Processing is **Natural Language Generation** (NLG).

- It is also sometimes described as the opposite of speech recognition. 
- It's the task of generating human language text responses by putting together structured information.
- This information follows **syntactical** and **semantic** rules from a program's knowledge base.

The best examples of real-world applications of this concept are **virtual agents** and **chatbots**. 
- Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa are examples of virtual agents.
- They use:
  - **Speech recognition** to understand user commands
  - **NLG** to respond with the required information or conduct the requested action.

A **Chatbot**, on the other hand, operates on **typed text**. 
- It processes and simulates **human dialogs** and **conversations**, allowing users to interact with various kinds of digital services. 

- They can be as simple as a program comprised of a set of **hard-coded rules**, to very sophisticated **AI-based** chatbots that deliver **personalized responses** and learn as they go.
