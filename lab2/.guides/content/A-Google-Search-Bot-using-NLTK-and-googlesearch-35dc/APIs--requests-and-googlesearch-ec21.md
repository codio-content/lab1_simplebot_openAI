- An application programming interface or API is a software interface for two applications or services to talk to each other. 

- It is often used in the context of server-side HTTP-based web APIs, that have a defined **requestâ€“response** message system.

- HTTP is a system of rules for fetching, creating or editing resources on the web (for eg. HTML documents, databases, etc.).

- Here are a few common methods that HTTP provides:
1. **GET**
The GET request is used to retrieve information using a given URL.

2. **POST**
A POST request is used to send information to a server.

3. **DELETE**
The DELETE method is used to request the server to delete a file at a location specified by the given URL.
