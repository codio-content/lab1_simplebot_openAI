### What is a corpus ?

- A corpus is a *large and structured set of text documents* that may serve as the **knowledge base** for a **corpus-based chatbot**.

- Such chatbots **don't have any manually created conditional rules** - instead, they use NLP techniques to learn mappings between user input and the required response.

- Depending on how it's designed, a corpus can be anywhere between **thousands** to **millions** of words!

- A chatbot corpus can be built/trained in a bunch of different ways, for instance: 
1. Manually copy-pasting data into a .txt file
2. Using an API to fetch data from the web
3. Using a library (for eg. *chatterbot*) to train a chatbot on a corpus

- The data used in any of these processes can be a **large conversational dataset** or even **news articles** and **online knowledge repositories** (eg. Wikipedia, etc.)
